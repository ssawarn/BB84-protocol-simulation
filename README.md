# Quantum-Key-Distribution-QKD-using-BB84-Protocol
BB84 simulation using Qiksit

This repository contains a quantum simulation of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution protocol developed in Qiskit. This protocol, fundamental to quantum communication, allows two users to generate a shared secret key that can be used to encrypt subsequent communication.

Here's how it works:

1. Alice generates two random bit strings of size 128, one representing quantum states and the other representing the basis (either X or Z) in which to prepare these states.

2. Similar to Alice, Bob also prepares a random bit string representing the basis in which he would measure the states once they are received from Alice.

3. Using a function 'create_bb84_circuit', a quantum circuit is prepared. This function uses Alice's state and basis to prepare the quantum states, and Bob's basis to make a measurement in the correct basis.

4. This quantum circuit is then executed using the QasmSimulator package from Qiskit. The circuit's bits are reversed before execution to accommodate the simulator's bit ordering.

5. Upon executing the circuit, we obtain the most frequent key from the resulting memory strings - this key represents a binary string.

6. The encryption key is then generated by comparing Alice's and Bob's basis. If, for a particular qubit, Alice's basis matches Bob's, then the corresponding key bit is included in the encryption key.

7. Additionally, the success rate of the key distribution is calculated. This is realized by determining the ratio of matching basis measurements between Alice and Bob.

8. Finally, the report prints out the secure encryption key and success probability. It also provides the length of the unmatched key, which signals the presence of any errors or eavesdropping attempts.

This quantum simulation of the BB84 protocol showcases the power of quantum security in communication systems and the potential of Qiskit as a tool for developing and testing quantum algorithms.
